#### ChIP-seq scripts

All the scripts for ChIP-seq data processing and simple downstream analyses.

The initial data processing is described in "ts220210_process_Ki67_chipseq.sh" (unsynchronized) and "ts220210_process_mitotic_Ki67_chipseq.sh" (metaphase synchronized). Further processing of the data was done with R markdown files:

  * ts220210_further_processing_chipseq: further processing of ChIP-seq counts, including Ki-67/input normalization (Fig S3).
  * ts220510_further_processing_chipseq: further processing of metaphase ChIP-seq counts, including Ki-67/input normalization (Fig S6).
