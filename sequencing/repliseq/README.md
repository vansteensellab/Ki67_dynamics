#### Repli-seq scripts

All the scripts for Repli-seq data processing and simple downstream analyses.

The initial data processing is described in "ts210802c_process_replication_timing.sh". Further processing of the data was done with R markdown files:

  * ts210802_further_processing_replication_timing: further processing of Repli-seq counts, including Early/Late normalization (Fig 5).
  * ts210802_centromere_overlap: simple script to specifically analyze replication timing at centromeres (Fig S7).
