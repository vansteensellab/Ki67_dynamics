#### Image analysis of m6A-Tracer enrichment

This directory contains scripts to quantify the enrichment of m6A-Tracer signal around domains segmented based on Ki-67 antibody staining. There is one macro (.ijs) to quantify images from a Leica .lif file. R markdown files contain the downstream processing and plotting.

  * ts210609_nucleolar_enrichment_cell_types: contains quantification of three (wildtype) cell lines (Fig 1)
  * ts210610_nucleolar_enrichment_Ki67_antibodies: contains quantification of three Ki67 antibodies (in HCT116 cells) (Fig S2)
  * ts210615_nucleolar_enrichment: contains quantification of hTERT-RPE cells during the cell cycle (Fig 2)
