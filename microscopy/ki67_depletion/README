This directory contains scripts prepared to quantify the depletion of Ki67 upon addition of auxin. There are two macros (.ijs) to quantify images from a Leica .lif file. One for z-stacks and one specifically for single sections (2D). R markdown files contain the downstream processing and plotting.

  * ts210609_ki67_intensity_following_auxin_depletion: contains quantification of z-stacks (Fig S1)
  * ts210609_ki67_intensity_following_auxin_depletion_other_antibodies_2D: contains quantification of single section (Fig S2)
