This GitHub page contains all scripts that were used for the Ki67 dynamics manuscript. These can be divided in scripts for microscopy data (image analysis) and for sequencing data (rna-seq, repli-seq, pa-damid). 

Except the initial data processing, all data analysis was performed in R using R markdown scripts. These scripts are also included here and provide introductions and conclusions of the described analyses. It is important to highlight that these scripts were not filtered to only include the figure panels that were used in the manuscript. This should provide a more transparant overview of our data analysis.
